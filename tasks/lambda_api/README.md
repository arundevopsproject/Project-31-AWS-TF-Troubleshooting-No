### Task Overview:
- We will set up a basic serverless application using AWS Lambda and API Gateway in this task.
- We aim to create a Lambda function that responds to HTTP requests, which will be exposed via an API Gateway endpoint.
- Weâ€™ll use Terraform to automate the deployment of these resources, including setting up the necessary permissions and configuring the API Gateway to route requests to our Lambda function.
- By the end of this task, we will have a fully operational serverless endpoint that can be accessed over the Internet.
